    cases but can be less reliable.
  * Enabled PAM authentication support (yet needs to be refined).

ejabberd (2.0.0-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Increased S2S timeouts. Defaults seems to be too short.
  * Removed a 5-minute delay between a remote server connect failure and the
    next connection attempt. It causes more harm than good.
  * Changed ownership of ejabberd config directory and SSL certificate to
    root:ejabberd and mode to to make sure they aren't overwritten by running
    ejabberd.
  * Remove an SSL certificate on package purge. It is assumed that it's a
    generated certificate, so the removal is unconditional.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Feb 2008 10:40:03 +0300

ejabberd (2.0.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Saved a little bit of resources by not starting ssl module which isn't
    used by ejabberd anymore.
  * Added several new variables to ejabberd script and default settings
    following upstream.
  * Added 'debug' option to ejabberdctl script which attaches Erlang shell to
    already running ejabberd server.
  * Removed useless README and /etc/ejabberd/ejabberdctl.cfg files from the
    binary package (/etc/ejabberd/ejabberdctl.cfg content is moved to
    /etc/default/ejabberd).
  * Added a patch which makes proxy65 module working with Erlang R12B.
  * Fixed position of override section in ejabberd.cfg and uncommented proxy65
    module (with adding restrictive options).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2008 18:36:46 +0300

ejabberd (1.1.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Loosened build dependencies to make backporting to etch easier.
  * Added a requirement for $remote_fs into init.d script because ejabberd
    needs mounted /usr to run.
  * Added a patch which allows ODBC to work with Erlang R12B.
  * Clarified debconf messages (closes: #390206).
  * Added a notice about hostname change to README.Debian and included erlang
    node conversion utility to the binary package (closes: #457097).
  * Added a patch which allows to use certificate chain files for encrypted
    connections (closes: #466676).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2008 18:21:32 +0300

ejabberd (1.1.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not remove /etc/ejabberd on package purge to preserve user files if
    any (closes: #460459).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.
  * Added homepage header to debian control file.
  * Fixed unnecessary space in doc-base.
  * Changed default setting for nicknames which can be registered to 'none'
    (which effectively forbids registration) as this setting is more safe
    (closes: #458627).
  * Fixed name section of ejabberd and ejabberdctl manual pages.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jan 2008 01:37:19 +0300

ejabberd (1.1.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes access rule check in mod_irc.
  * Added a patch which fixes ejabberd build using erlang R12B-0.
  * Increased number of erlang ports in /etc/ejabberd/default. The default
    value of 1024 allows too few simultaneous connections (from 300 to 500
    for both clients and servers depending of whether they use SSL or traffic
    compression).
  * Fixed shell backquotes in ejabberd and ejabberdctl manual pages. Also
    bumped their versions to 1.1.4.
  * Added a note about binding to privileged ports to README.Debian.
  * Fixed a race condition between starting log handler and port listener.
    Otherwise, error reports about port binding can't get into log file
    (closes: #458518).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 01 Jan 2008 17:09:57 +0300

ejabberd (1.1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch by upstream which fixes usage of relational databases in
    ejabberd modules while using internal or LDAP-based authentication
    (closes: #446848). The patch was adopted from ejabberd SVN by Andreas
    Oberritter.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Oct 2007 10:34:07 +0400

ejabberd (1.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved ejabberd application directory from
    /usr/lib/erlang/lib/ejabberd-1.1.4 to /usr/lib/ejabberd to avoid conflicts
    of modules names (specifically, eldap module conflicts with shiiped in Yxa
    SIP server).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Oct 2007 10:07:19 +0400

ejabberd (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Fixed debian/watch file.
  * Removed ejabberd_sm.diff patch. This makes ejabberd using recommended
    error condition <service-unavailable/> instead of
    <feature-not-implemented/>. There was sufficient time to fix broken
    clients.
  * Removed perl-path.diff, shaper.diff, ejabberd_http_poll.diff, eldap.diff,
    sql_escape.diff patches since they are included into upstream release.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

    (closes: #428864).

    prevent installation of ejabberd which uses incompatible erlang ABI.
  * Included ejabberd headers to binary package to make building external
    modules for ejabberd possible (closes: #428081).

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Security fix, mentioned in 1.1.2-5 was backported from SVN and not
    from 1.1.3, where it is incomplete (the bug affects ejabberd only if
    users' rosters are stored in relational database, and not in Mnesia,
    which is default).
  * Moved patches to debian directory. This fixes cleaning up
    after build process. (Closes: #424193)
  * Moved creating user ejabberd from preinst to postinst because preinst
    cannot rely on existence of adduser package.
  * Added a comment to ejabberd.cfg concerning UTF-8 encoding.
  * Unfuzzied one string in russian debconf translation (closes: #408410).
  * Removed annoying message about existing SSL certificate.
  * Fixed references to ejabberd installation and operation guide in manual
    pages (closes: #416050).
  * Backup ejabberd database on package removal or upgrade to a subdirectory
    of /var/backups instead of /var/tmp (closes: #409916).
  * Do not change /etc/ejabberd, /var/lib/ejabberd and /var/log/ejabberd
    ownership and permissions if they are overridden using dpkg-statoverride
    (closes: #416178).
  * Conditionally source /usr/share/debconf/confmodule in postrm script as
    debconf isn't an essential package (closes: #416743).
  * Included Portuguese translation of debconf messages (closes: #416779).
